# UFOs Sighting with JavaScript 

# Overview of Project: 
The purpose of this project was to create a table to organize UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript array, or list. We used This table to filter data based on certain criteria that was provided to us from a data JavaScript file. Also, to explain the strengths and weaknesses of JavaScript "standard" and JavaScript version ES6+.

# Summary: 

  # Drawbacks
      1. In order for a user to interact with the search bar the user must know the dates, cities, and shapes that they'll need for the search to be successful. 

  # Recommendations
      1. The filter options should allow upper and lower cased spellings to avoid confusing the users.
      2. The search should offer autofill suggestions to ensure a faster search.
